Right click on a .py file and hit "Get Info". Scroll down to "Open With" and change to IDLE. Afterwards hit "Change All" to make it persist for all .py files.

If you simply hit "Open With" and try to make IDLE the default from that menu, it only makes IDLE the default editor for that exact file, not all .py files.
